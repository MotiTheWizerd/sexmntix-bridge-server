Need to add folder detection logic (paths ending with / or \\ without extension).\n\n2. MD ICON: ExtensionMapper uses 'file-type-markdown' which user finds ugly. Need to replace with better icon.\n\nSOLUTION APPROACH:\n- Add folder detection in ExtensionExtractor (return 'folder' for paths without extensions ending in separator)\n- Update IconResolver to handle folder context\n- Change markdown icon from 'file-type-markdown' to better alternative (maybe 'vscode-icons:file-type-markdown' or custom)",
