ProviderWorkingRouter (36 lines) - Routes STATUS_PROVIDER_WORKING events\n2. ChatIdFilter (59 lines) - Filters events by chatId for multi-chat support\n3. InjectionCoordinator (83 lines) - Centralized dependency injection coordination\n4. ComponentFactory (83 lines) - Factory pattern for building/wiring components\n5. EventBinder (75 lines) - Centralized event-to-router binding\n\nARCHITECTURE NOW:\n- 14 focused modules (9 existing + 5 new)\n- 1 lightweight orchestrator (131 lines, down from 206)\n- Total: 15 ultra-modular components\n\nBUILD STATUS: ✅ Successful (no errors)\n\nBENEFITS ACHIEVED:\n✅ Single Responsibility - Each module has one clear purpose\n✅ Zero Breaking Changes - All public APIs identical\n✅ Enhanced Testability - Each module independently testable\n✅ Better Maintainability - Changes isolated to specific modules\n✅ Improved Scalability - Easy to add new routers/filters\n✅ Clear Separation - Construction, binding, routing, injection all separated",
