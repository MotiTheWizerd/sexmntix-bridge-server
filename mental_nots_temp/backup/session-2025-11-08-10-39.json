Reviewing GridShineSweepController.js (377 lines) which has multiple mixed concerns: DOM creation, SVG mask generation, animation timing, cube highlighting, gradient creation, and color management. Will apply our proven ultra-modular orchestrator pattern used in 17+ previous refactorings to break this into focused micro-components.",
