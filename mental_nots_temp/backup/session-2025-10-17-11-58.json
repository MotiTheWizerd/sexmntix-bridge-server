Reviewing recent work: we've successfully refactored chat-tabs CSS (383→26-line orchestrator+13 modules), message-list CSS (776→32-line orchestrator+9 modules), tool-permission CSS (309→27-line orchestrator+5 modules), and triple message handlers (620+308+156 lines → 22 focused components). Looking at git status to identify next candidates for ultra-modular transformation.",

Current structure has 6 mixed concerns: DOM transformations, placeholder-to-streaming conversion, provider-specific indicator logic, element creation, state management (streamedText, isFirstChunk), and provider name resolution. Good candidate for breaking into focused micro-components following our proven orchestrator pattern.",
