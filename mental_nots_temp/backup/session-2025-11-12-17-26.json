      "content": "Working with Moti on refactoring SemantixLogoOrchestrator.js using our established ultra-modular pattern.\n\nCurrent state: 212-line orchestrator that's already been partially refactored, but still has issues:\n1. Components are initialized but still pass dependencies around in method parameters\n2. setGridSize() takes 6 parameters (lines 99-106) - should delegate to component\n3. destroy() passes dependencies to cleanupManager (lines 152-156) - components should own their dependencies\n4. Public API methods just delegate to facade but could be cleaner\n\nOur ultra-modular pattern from 17+ previous refactorings:\n- Orchestrator should be ~120 lines (currently 212)\n- Each component owns its dependencies via constructor injection\n- No passing dependencies as method parameters\n- Single responsibility per component\n- Facade pattern for public API\n- Zero breaking changes for consumers",
