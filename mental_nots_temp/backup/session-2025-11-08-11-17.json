      "content": "Successfully decoupled \"Sementix\" text from SVG in welcome screen. \n\nChanges:\n1. Removed SVG <text> element from WelcomeLogoSVG.js (line 175)\n2. Added HTML <div class=\"logo-text\">Sementix</div> in WelcomeScreenDOM.js after SVG\n3. Updated CSS to use background gradient with -webkit-background-clip: text for metallic effect\n4. Changed selector from .welcome-logo .logo-text to .logo-text\n\nBenefits: Better separation of concerns (SVG = cubes only), easier text modifications, cleaner architecture. Build passes ✅",

Grid cell size: 40px x 40px (fine net pattern). Stroke-only lines (no fill), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03) for subtle appearance. No animation, completely static.

Highlights 10-20 random background grid cells every 6 seconds (synchronized with GridShineSweep timing). Uses same ColorPaletteProvider (RGB-only: 9 shades). Cells fade in with radial gradient, hold for 4 seconds, then fade out. Integrated into WelcomeScreen orchestrator as 7th animation controller. CSS added for .background-grid-overlay and .grid-cell-highlight. Build passes ✅",

Modified GridShineSweepController to generate random gradient each sweep. Updated SweepAnimationExecutor.executeSweep() to accept dynamic gradient parameter. Removed hardcoded gradient from WelcomeScreen config. Now each sweep has randomized color order - cubes end with different colors (red, green, or blue) instead of always red. Build passes ✅",
