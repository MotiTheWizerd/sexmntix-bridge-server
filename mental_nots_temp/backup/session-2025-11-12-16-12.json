      "content": "## Semantix Logo Animation Architecture Research\n\n### Key Components Analyzed:\n1. SemantixLogoOrchestrator.js - Main coordinator\n2. CSSWaveController.js - CSS-based wave animation\n3. PulseWaveAnimation.js - Anime.js-based pulse animation\n4. CubeGridManager.js - Cube collection manager\n5. SemantixCube.js - Individual cube controller\n6. SemantixLogoSVG.js - SVG generation\n7. SemantixLogoConfig.js - Configuration\n\n### Animation Controller Interface Requirements:\n- start() - Begin animation\n- stop() - End animation and cleanup\n- pause() - Pause animation (can resume)\n- resume() - Resume paused animation\n- continue() - Restart after grid size change\n- updateGridSize(newGridSize) - Update grid reference\n- isActive() - Check if running\n\n### SVG Structure & Colors:\n- Each cube has unique linearGradient fill (grad-1 to grad-16)\n- Gradients use 5-stop color scheme: #999999 → #777777 → #555555 → #333333 → #222222\n- Cubes are SVG <rect> elements with class \"logo-cube\"\n- Each has data-cube attribute (1-16), x, y, width, height, opacity\n\n### Color Manipulation Approach for Gradient Wave:\nCan modify CSS custom properties dynamically on cube elements to create color gradients propagating from center outward",
