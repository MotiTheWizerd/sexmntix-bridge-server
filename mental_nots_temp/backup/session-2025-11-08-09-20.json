      "content": "Welcome screen logo cube opacity randomization - Fixed initial opacity issue where all 16 cubes started with only two values (0.3 and 0.4 alternating pattern), causing no visible animation for 3-5 seconds until flash/fade animations kicked in. Added randomization logic in createWelcomeElement() to set each cube's initial opacity to random value between 0.3 and 0.85, creating immediate visual variation on load.

Cubes are 20x20px, so radius 10 would create perfect circles, but 7.5 keeps them recognizably square-ish with rounded corners. Modified radiusConfig in WelcomeScreen.js line 50.",

Gradients now morph their stop positions (0%, 50%, 100%) using sine waves with independent random phases per cube. Center stop oscillates ±20% (30%-70%), outer stops ±15%. Creates breathing metallic shine effect. Added gradientMorphConfig (morphSpeed: 0.003, centerStopRange: 0.2, outerStopRange: 0.15) and enhanced animateGradients() to morph stops alongside rotation.

Updated normalRadius from 3 to 0 in radiusConfig and changed all 16 SVG rect elements from rx=\"3\" to rx=\"0\". Cubes now default to sharp corners and occasionally morph to rounded (up to 7.5) during animation. Modified WelcomeScreen.js line 48 and lines 198-216.",

Wider shade range: white (#ffffff) → light gray (#cccccc) → dark gray (#666666) → black (#000000). Each gradient has unique center position (cx, cy). Updated animation to orbit light source around cube center (±20% radius), morph gradient radius (70% ± 15% breathing effect), and oscillate stop positions (30% ± 10%, 60% ± 15%).
