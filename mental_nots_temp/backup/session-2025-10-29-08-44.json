Is STATUS_READY actually being fired? (check SystemLifecycle.js)\n2. Is the event listener registered at the right time?\n3. Should use Logger, not console.log\n4. Should understand the event flow before making more changes",

      "content": "Fixed splash screen race condition:\n\n**Problem:** STATUS_READY event was emitted during ui.start() BEFORE the listener was registered, so splash screen never got hidden.\n\n**Solution:** \n1. Reordered main.js to register the STATUS_READY listener BEFORE calling ui.start()\n2. Replaced console.log with proper Logger calls (ui.core.logger)\n3. Added informative logging at each step for debugging\n\n**Key insight:** ui.start() emits STATUS_READY synchronously, so timing matters. Listener must exist before the event is emitted.\n\n**Files modified:**\n- src/ui/app/main.js - Reordered code and added proper logging",
