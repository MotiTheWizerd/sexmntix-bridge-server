Claude CLI sent permission_denials for Bash tool ✅\n2. PermissionChunkProcessor detected them ✅\n3. Checked settings and found Bash = true (auto-approved) ✅\n4. Called handleAutoApproval to silently approve ✅\n5. The only error was missing chatId parameter in auto-approval path\n\nBut the CORE functionality is working:\n- BashCommandPermissionMapper correctly identifies terminal commands\n- Permission system detects and processes Bash permissions\n- Auto-approval honors user settings\n\nThe chatId error is real but separate from the \"dialog not showing\" issue - that was just user settings!",
