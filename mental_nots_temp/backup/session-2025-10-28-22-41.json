      "content": "Session Summary: Tabs Design Marathon - Complete UI Overhaul\n\nThis was an incredible session where we transformed the chat tabs design from the ground up. Started with fixing a double-border issue and ended with a complete redesign plus intelligent chat naming based on conversation history.\n\n## Major Achievements:\n1. **Visual Design Overhaul**: Removed double borders, implemented dark gradient backgrounds, reduced tab size, made icons grayscale for inactive tabs with full color for active tab\n2. **Smart Chat Naming**: Implemented event-driven architecture to name new chats based on total conversation history (history sessions + open tabs)\n3. **Clean Architecture**: Used event-based decoupling to connect ChatTabManager with HeaderDropdown's session count\n\n## Key Technical Decisions:\n- Event-driven communication pattern for loose coupling\n- CSS variable-based theming for easy customization\n- Ultra-modular component architecture maintained throughout\n\n## User Style Observed:\n- Prefers iterative, visual-driven development\n- Values clean, modern UI with attention to detail\n- Likes to see immediate results and iterate based on visual feedback\n- Comfortable with architectural discussions and making design decisions\n\nThe session showcased excellent collaboration with clear communication about technical tradeoffs and implementation approaches.",
