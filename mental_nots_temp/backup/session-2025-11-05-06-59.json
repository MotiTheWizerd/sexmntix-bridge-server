We tried multiple approaches (transform, margin-top, spacer div) but all failed due to .message-list having position:absolute. This removes it from document flow, breaking flex-based height calculation.\n\nTwo paths identified:\n1. Remove position:absolute if not required for multi-chat\n2. Create NEW_INNER_WRAPPER to reconcile flex layout with absolute positioning\n\nNext steps: Investigate why .message-list needs position:absolute, check if multi-chat requires it.",

Result: 30 minutes to working animation vs multiple failed sessions in production. Key insight: When stuck in complexity, build simpler version first with real CSS but simplified structure.",
