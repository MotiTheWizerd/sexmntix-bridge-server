      "content": "StreamInitializer v3 Right-Sizing Refactor - Conservative Approach\n\nApplied Right-Sizing Evolution philosophy to StreamInitializer:\n\nREFACTORING DECISION:\n- Chose conservative Option A over aggressive consolidation\n- Removed only verified dead code (getProviderName with 0 call sites)\n- Kept pure delegation methods for API stability and encapsulation\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n1. Removed getProviderName() method (6 lines) - grep confirmed 0 call sites\n2. Removed providerIconBuilder dependency from constructor\n3. Updated ComponentFactory.js to match new constructor signature\n4. Enhanced documentation explaining v1→v2→v3 evolution\n\nRATIONALE FOR KEEPING FACADE:\n- start() method provides meaningful orchestration (20 lines of logic)\n- Pure delegation methods (5 total) add minimal overhead\n- Maintains clean API for 5 dependent components: TextAccumulator, FirstChunkDetector, StreamCompleter, StreamErrorHandler, StreamCleanupCoordinator\n- Encapsulation benefit > navigation cost for this complexity level\n\nLINES SAVED: ~10 lines (dead code + dependency)\nBUILD STATUS: ✅ Passed\nBREAKING CHANGES: None\n\nPHILOSOPHY APPLIED: Component count is NOT a metric. StreamInitializer provides meaningful orchestration through start() and clean state management facade. Keeping it aligns with \"right-sized\" not \"minimal-sized\" architecture.",
