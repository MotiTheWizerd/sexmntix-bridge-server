Each ring has different color (orange/purple/blue/pink). Claude SVG rotates slowly in reverse direction with color-shifting glow.\n\n2. Energy Pulse - 4 rippling energy waves emanating from Claude SVG like radar pulses. Waves scale from 0 to 3x with opacity fade. Claude SVG pulses in sync with waves, changing colors with each pulse.\n\nBoth spinners follow ultra-modular pattern, include isolation toggle, animated text rotation, and are integrated into main index.html. Collection now has 8 spinners total.",
