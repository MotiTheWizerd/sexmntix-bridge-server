Semantic Memory - Long-term recall via search_memory/search_memory_by_date\n2. Notebook - Session notes (note/decision/error/gotcha types)\n3. Delta Memories - Structured technical achievement records in .sementix/memories/delta/\n\n**Workflow Recommendation**: \n- Start sessions by searching semantic memory for context\n- Read latest notebook entries\n- Search recent work from last 7 days\n- Review accomplishments before tackling new tasks\n\nMoti's greeting: \"Hi Champ!
