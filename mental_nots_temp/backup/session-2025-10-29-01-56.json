Key insight: Inline code (`backticks`) is NOT implemented yet - this will add both inline code support AND file icon integration together. Architecture: Create InlineCodePatternHandler following existing pattern (BoldPatternHandler, HeaderPatternHandler), integrate FileIconService.getIconSync() for filename detection, inject icon HTML before code tag.",

Already have FileIconService integration, just need to detect file patterns in streaming ClaudeFormatter and output badge HTML instead of code tags.",
