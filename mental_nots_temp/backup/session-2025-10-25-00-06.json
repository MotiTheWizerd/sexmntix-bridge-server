      "content": "PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Gemini CLI not spawning in correct workspace\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\n1. Codex pattern: WorkspaceResolver gets vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath\n2. CodexService constructor calls workspaceResolver.getWorkspaceFolder() and stores in StateManager\n3. StreamingApiOrchestrator passes stateManager.getWorkspaceFolder() to CLI executor as cwd option\n4. CodexCLIExecutor uses cwd in spawn options: spawnOptions.cwd = cwd\n\nGemini current state:\n- GeminiService line 83: passes this.config.workspaceFolder to executor\n- But GeminiService constructor doesn't set config.workspaceFolder\n- Need to create WorkspaceResolver for Gemini and populate workspaceFolder\n\nSolution needed: Follow Codex ultra-modular pattern with WorkspaceResolver component",
