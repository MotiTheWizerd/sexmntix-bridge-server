They're both applying CSS classes to the same cube elements:\n- CSSWaveController adds 'wave-animating' class\n- ColorGradientWaveController adds 'color-wave-animating' class\n\nBoth animations are running simultaneously and competing for the same elements. The CSS animations are likely conflicting on the 'fill' attribute.",

When both run, only one executes because setting a new animation property overwrites the previous one.\n\nKEY FINDING: The CSS spec allows multiple animations via comma-separated values in the `animation` property, but current implementation sets them independently.\n\nCurrent Animation Property Patterns:\n- CSSWaveController: Sets on .logo-cube.wave-animating via CSS rule\n  animation: wave-pulse var(--wave-duration) var(--wave-easing) var(--wave-delay) infinite\n  \n- ColorGradientWaveController: Sets on .color-wave-animating via CSS rule\n  animation: colorWave var(--color-wave-duration) var(--color-wave-easing) var(--color-wave-delay) infinite\n\nBoth use classes added to elements, not inline styles. CSS rules stack, but animation property overwrites.\n\nSOLUTION APPROACH: Create MultiAnimationManager to track and rebuild animation property using comma-separated values.",
