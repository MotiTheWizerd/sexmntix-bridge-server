Second message \"hello\" → chatId: 'waiting_for_id' → Generated UUID: 478f2466-d4b4-4a90-b2ae-4b80f33dd35f\n\nTWO DIFFERENT UUIDs GENERATED! But user says they show \"same id\" in UI.\n\nThis means:\n- Extension IS generating different UUIDs ✅\n- BUT UI tabs are showing same ID ❌\n\nThe bug is in the UI! AutoTabCreator or the tab rename logic is NOT working. Both tabs are being renamed to the FIRST UUID, not their respective UUIDs!",

We're probably always sending the first tab's chatId or always sending 'waiting_for_id'.\n\nNeed to check MessageSendHandler and MessageTransport - where do they get the chatId when sending user messages?",
