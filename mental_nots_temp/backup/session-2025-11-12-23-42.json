Complete permission dialog redesign - moved from glassmorphism to compact dark metallic theme\n2. 3-choice permission system (Allow Once, Allow for Session, Always Allow)\n3. Fixed permission routing for multi-tab support\n4. System messages for permission refusals (orange messages in chat)\n5. Multi-state architecture to prevent dialog disappearing issues\n\nCurrent git status shows:\n- Modified files across permission system, streaming handlers, UI controllers\n- Several new files: AllowedToolsTracker.ts, AllowedToolsResolver.ts, ScopedBashPermissionResolver.ts\n- Recent commits about \"3 choice system\" and \"permission design\"\n\nLooking at untracked delta memories in git status:\n- proactive-permission-system-per-session-implementation.json\n- scoped-bash-permission-leakage-fix.json  \n- three-choice-permission-system-per-chat-session.json\n\nThese suggest we just implemented the 3-choice system and fixed bash permission scoping!",
