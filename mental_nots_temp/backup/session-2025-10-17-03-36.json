Recent DI Container refactoring of AgentMessagesManager created TWO critical bugs:\n\nBUG 1: Import path error in CodeHighlightIntegrator.js - wrong relative path depth\nBUG 2: Broken dependency injection chain - hid domReferences inside container, breaking UIControllerManager\n\nBoth bugs were already fixed in previous session, changes visible in git diff:\n- CodeHighlightIntegrator.js: Fixed import path (added one more \"../\")  \n- AgentMessagesManager.js: Added domReferences getter for backward compatibility\n\nCurrent status: Need to verify if bugs are actually resolved or if there are additional issues.",

AgentMessagesManager.js:46-52 - domReferences getter exists for backward compatibility\n\nFiles confirmed working. Need to ask Moti what specific bug they're experiencing now.",
