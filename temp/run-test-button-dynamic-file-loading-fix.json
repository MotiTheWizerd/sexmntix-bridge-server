  "summary": "Run Test button failing with VS Code API conflicts and missing bridge commands → Fixed API acquisition method and implemented complete bridge communication chain",
  "root_cause": "VSCodeBridge attempted to call acquireVsCodeApi() when extension had already acquired it, plus missing getMemoryFiles command in extension bridge handler",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Fix VS Code API conflict by using existing window.vscode instance, then implement missing bridge command with comprehensive logging",
    "key_changes": [
      "VSCodeBridge.js: Modified getVSCodeApi() to use existing window.vscode instead of acquiring new API instance",
      "MemorySearchExtensionBridge.ts: Added getMemoryFiles case to switch statement and implemented filesystem scanning method",
