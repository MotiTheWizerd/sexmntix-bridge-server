  "summary": "Permission dialog disappearing immediately after user action due to race condition → Added wait_tool_confirmation state for proper UI flow with instant user feedback",
  "root_cause": "Extension was immediately setting UI state back to 'active' upon receiving permission response, causing ConfirmationController to hide dialog before user could see result of their action",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Staged implementation adding new UI state to provide immediate user feedback while maintaining event-driven architecture and proper separation of concerns",
    "key_changes": [
      "ui-state.ts: Added 'wait_tool_confirmation' to UIState type and validation helper for new workflow state",
      "ConfirmationController.js: Modified handleAllow/handleDeny to immediately emit wait_tool_confirmation state and hide dialog before sending response to extension",
      "ConfirmationController.js: Updated handleUIStateChange with comprehensive switch statement for all state transitions",
      "LogicManager.ts: Removed immediate 'active' state setting, added simulated processing time before returning to active state"
