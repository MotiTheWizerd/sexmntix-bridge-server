  "summary": "Non-functional view mode buttons + bloated UI spacing → Working cards/compact toggle + 40-50% density increase showing more results",
  "root_cause": "View buttons bound before HTML loaded due to async component loading, CSS had excessive padding/margins/font-sizes optimized for desktop not information density",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Fixed timing with requestAnimationFrame + retry fallback, wired ViewModeManager to store/re-render results, systematically reduced all spacing/fonts by 20-40%",
    "key_changes": [
      "SearchPageController.js: Added requestAnimationFrame delay + 100ms retry fallback to ensure DOM ready before binding events",
      "ViewModeManager.js: Added resultRenderer reference + currentResults storage + re-render logic on mode change",
      "ResultDisplayCoordinator.js: Passes results to ViewModeManager after every display/sort operation",
      "SearchResults.html: Removed middle list-view button keeping only cards and compact",
      "search-page.css: Reduced page padding 16px→8px, header title 28px→20px, input padding 10px→8px, result padding 16px→10px, filename 16px→13px, badges 11px→10px, preview 14px→12px, tags 11px→10px, stats 11px→10px, margins/gaps reduced across board",
      "search-page.css: Compact view ultra-dense - 8px padding, 9-12px fonts, 6px gap between items",
      "search-page.css: Removed problematic min-height:fit-content that was collapsing cards"

  },
  "validation": "User confirmed 'DAMN BOY! that work perfect 🧑🏻‍🔬' after button fix, manual testing showed buttons switching views with proper re-rendering, visual confirmation of dramatically increased result density",
  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "View buttons not clickable - events bound before DOM loaded. Component loader uses async loading but SearchPageController init was synchronous causing race condition",

      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "high"

    {
      "issue": "View mode changed button state but didn't re-render results - ViewModeManager had no reference to renderer or current results",

      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "high"

    {
      "issue": "Result cards collapsed to zero height after metallic styling - min-height:fit-content was buggy CSS",

  "lesson": "DOM timing is critical in component-based UIs with async loading - always add defensive delays (requestAnimationFrame) and retry logic. Information-dense UIs need aggressive spacing reduction - cut padding/margins by 30-40% and fonts by 2-4px for dramatic density gains without losing readability. User-spotted bugs are gold - they know exactly what's broken.",
