  "outcomes": {
    "performance_impact": "Major improvement: Auth caching 99.96% faster (2879ms → 1ms), eliminated redundant CLI calls",

  "summary": "Scattered CLI execution logic → centralized single source of truth with beautiful natural API and 99.96% auth performance improvement",
  "root_cause": "Duplicate CLI command execution scattered across components, repeated auth checks without caching, type duplication across modules causing maintenance issues",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Staged refactoring: centralized CLI methods → auth caching → clean API → type deduplication",
    "key_changes": [
      "CLIExecutor.ts: Added claudeMessage() and claudeVersion() specialized methods with configurable timeouts",
      "AuthManager.ts: Added ensureReady() with 5-minute auth result caching and clearCache() method",
      "ClaudeCodeService.ts: Renamed sendMessage() → askClaude() with clean separation of concerns",
      "types.ts: Single source of truth for all CLI wrapper types, eliminated duplicates",
      "package.json: Added test:claude-message and test:auth-manager npm scripts"
