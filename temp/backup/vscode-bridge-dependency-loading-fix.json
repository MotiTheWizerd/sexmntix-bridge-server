  "summary": "ReferenceError: WebViewLogger is not defined → 12 bridge dependency scripts loaded before VSCodeBridge.js in 4 HTML files",
  "root_cause": "VSCodeBridge refactoring promoted modular architecture but HTML files never updated - loaded VSCodeBridge.js directly without its 12 required dependencies (utils, core, commands, registry modules)",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Add complete dependency chain before VSCodeBridge.js in all HTML files - ensure utils→core→commands→registry→bridge loading order",
    "key_changes": [
      "search.html: Added 12 bridge dependency script tags before VSCodeBridge.js line 191 - enables SearchPageController to instantiate bridge without errors",
      "index.html: Added 12 bridge dependency script tags before VSCodeBridge.js line 120 - fixes dashboard initialization",

      "issue": "4 HTML files needed identical updates - easy to miss one or introduce inconsistent ordering across files",
