  "summary": "Multi-provider launch would delay 1-2+ months → Launch with Claude + Memory FIRST, add other providers 2-4 weeks after public release",

  "root_cause": "Waiting for multi-provider implementation (Codex, Gemini, Qwen) would significantly delay time-to-market without proportional value gain at launch",

  "validation": "Strategy validated through discussion - focuses effort on polish over breadth, enables faster user feedback loop",
