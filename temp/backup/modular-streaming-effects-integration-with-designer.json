  "summary": "Monolithic demo.js with duplicate streaming controls → Integrated modular streaming system with designer-controlled effects and unified control panel",
  "root_cause": "Original demo had streaming mode controls in chat UI duplicating designer sidebar functionality, and no integration between designer tool and actual streaming engine",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Create modular streaming architecture with iframe communication bridge, remove duplicate controls, and establish designer as single control source",
    "key_changes": [
      "designer.html: Changed iframe src from index.html to demo-modular.html for enhanced streaming capabilities",
      "ChatInterface.js: Added comprehensive iframe message listener for designer communication (START_STREAMING, PAUSE_STREAM, STOP_STREAM, SET_STREAMING_MODE)",
      "DemoControls.js: Removed duplicate streaming mode buttons, kept only essential demo controls (Toggle Typing, Cycle Spinner, Add Tool Message)",
      "StreamingService.js: Created bridge between modular components and existing StreamingController with event-driven communication",
      "streaming-designer-extensions.js: Enhanced with bidirectional communication, real-time status updates, and longer response content",
      "streaming-controller.js: Added cleanupStreamingEffects method to prevent matrix mode flashing, enhanced speed configuration",
      "ResponseGenerator.js: Extended with comprehensive long-form responses for dramatic streaming effects",
      "streaming-chunks.css: Added visual effects CSS for scanner, fire-spark, matrix, and default streaming modes"
