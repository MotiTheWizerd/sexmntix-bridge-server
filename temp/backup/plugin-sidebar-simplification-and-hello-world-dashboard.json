  "outcomes": {

  "summary": "Complex 13-item sidebar with heavy dashboard components on load → Clean 3-link navigation (Dashboard, Memories, File Monitor) with lightweight Hello World landing page",
  "root_cause": "After completing plugin system migration, sidebar still showed all 13 memory-search internal tools. User wanted simple top-level navigation with 3 main features instead of exposing internal complexity.",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Three-stage simplification: (1) Reduce FeatureBootstrap sidebar manifest from 4 sections/13 items to 1 section/3 items, (2) Add SimpleDashboard and PlaceholderView components to NavigationController for lightweight views, (3) Fix NavigationController.init() call in SPAInitializer to trigger initial view load",
    "key_changes": [
      "registry/FeatureBootstrap.js: Replaced 4 complex sections (Processing, Vector Database, Search & Query, Testing) with single 'Main Navigation' section containing 3 links: Dashboard (/dashboard), Memories (/memory-search/search), File Monitor (/file-monitor)",
      "registry/FeatureBootstrap.js: Changed default dashboard route from /memory-search/dashboard to /dashboard with SimpleDashboard component",
      "registry/FeatureBootstrap.js: Added PlaceholderView for File Monitor 'coming soon' feature",
      "controllers/NavigationController.plugin.js: Changed default route from '/memory-search/dashboard' to '/dashboard'",
      "controllers/NavigationController.plugin.js: Added SimpleDashboard case to switch statement for Hello World view",
      "controllers/NavigationController.plugin.js: Added PlaceholderView case for future features",
      "controllers/NavigationController.plugin.js: Implemented loadSimpleDashboard() method - centered 'Hello World' with inline styles, no component loading",
      "controllers/NavigationController.plugin.js: Implemented loadPlaceholderView() method - centered 'Coming soon' message for File Monitor",
      "initialization/SPAInitializer.js: Added navigationController.init() call after construction to trigger initial view load (was missing, caused blank screen)"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "User opened dashboard and saw: (1) Sidebar with exactly 3 links under 'Main Navigation', (2) Clicking Memories loaded full semantic search interface with search results, (3) Search functionality fully working - searched 'ui dashboard plugin' and got 10 results with tags, filters, sorting",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "After simplifying sidebar, main content area was blank - no Hello World or any view showing",
      "solution": "Added navigationController.init() call in SPAInitializer.js line 73 - the NavigationController was being constructed but init() method was never called, so no initial navigation/view load occurred",
      "category": "initialization",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Console showed 'NavigationController current view: dashboard' but no content rendered",
      "solution": "The init() method sets up event listeners AND calls navigateTo(currentRoute) which actually loads the view - without init() call, just constructing the object does nothing",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "medium"
    }
  ],

  "lesson": "When refactoring complex systems, verify the ENTIRE initialization chain - object construction alone doesn't mean initialization. The NavigationController followed a two-step pattern: constructor() sets defaults, init() performs actual setup and initial navigation. Missing init() call is a common gotcha after refactoring.",
