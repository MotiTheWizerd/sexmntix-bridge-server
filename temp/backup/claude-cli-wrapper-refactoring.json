  "summary": "Monolithic CLI wrapper → scalable component architecture with 100% test coverage and production-ready Claude CLI integration",
  "root_cause": "Original ClaudeCodeCLIWrapper.ts was a monolithic class mixing VS Code dependencies, CLI execution, auth, and state management making it untestable and hard to maintain",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Single Responsibility Principle: Split into focused components with dependency injection and comprehensive testing",
    "key_changes": [
      "CLIExecutor: Pure command execution with child_process abstraction",
      "AuthManager: CLI authentication and version checking logic",
      "StateManager: Service state transitions and status tracking",
      "ClaudeCodeService: Main orchestrator coordinating all components",
      "100 unit tests covering all functionality with proper mocking",
      "Interactive terminal test runner for manual testing",
      "Updated ClaudeCodeCLIAdapter to use real implementation"
    ]
  },
  "validation": "All 100 unit tests passing, build successful, terminal test runner functional, proper error handling for auth failures",
  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Jest module mocking required hoisted mocks before imports to work with promisify(exec)",
      "solution": "Moved mock declarations above imports and used hoisted mock functions",
      "category": "testing",
      "severity": "medium"
    },
    {
      "issue": "CLI command was 'claude-code' but actual CLI uses 'claude'",
      "solution": "Updated all command strings from 'claude-code' to 'claude' throughout codebase",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "TypeScript strict typing issues with jest.Mocked<> for classes with private properties",

      "category": "testing",
      "severity": "low"
    }
  ],
  "lesson": "When refactoring monolithic classes, start with the most isolated components (StateManager) then work up to orchestrators. Comprehensive testing catches integration issues early.",
