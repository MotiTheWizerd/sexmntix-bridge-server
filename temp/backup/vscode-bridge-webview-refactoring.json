  "summary": "448-line monolithic VSCodeBridge.js with singleton pattern and mixed concerns → 13-file modular architecture with command pattern, DI, and JavaScript Proxy for dynamic method routing (~120 LOC main orchestrator)",
  "root_cause": "Legacy JavaScript WebView bridge grew organically without architectural planning, resulting in singleton pattern, mixed responsibilities, excessive console.log statements, and no separation of concerns",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Complete architectural redesign using command pattern, dependency injection, and JavaScript Proxy pattern for dynamic method generation - all in pure JavaScript for browser compatibility",
    "key_changes": [
      "VSCodeBridge-refactored.js: Created 120-LOC orchestrator using Proxy pattern to auto-generate 16 method wrappers dynamically",
      "utils/: WebViewLogger for structured logging, IdGenerator for request correlation IDs",
      "core/: VSCodeApiManager handles API acquisition + mock creation, MessageDispatcher manages postMessage + pendingRequests Map",
      "commands/: Extracted 16 operations into 5 grouped command files (SearchCommands, SystemCommands, FileCommands, EmbeddingCommands, DirectoryCommands)",
      "registry/: WebViewDependencies DI container, WebViewCommandRegistry routes commands to handlers"
    ]
  },
  "validation": "Comprehensive architectural refactoring completed with all 13 modular files created, Proxy pattern implemented for zero-boilerplate method generation, full API compatibility maintained",
  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Initial plan used TypeScript but ui-dashboard runs in browser WebView without build step",
      "solution": "Pivoted to pure JavaScript with JSDoc comments for type hints - maintains consistency with existing dashboard code",

      "severity": "high"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Main orchestrator initially 286 lines with 16 repetitive wrapper methods",
      "solution": "Implemented JavaScript Proxy pattern to auto-generate method wrappers dynamically, reducing to ~120 LOC",
      "category": "architecture",
      "severity": "medium"
    },
    {
      "issue": "Singleton pattern made original bridge difficult to test and created hidden dependencies",
      "solution": "Replaced with dependency injection container pattern - all dependencies explicit and injectable",
      "category": "testing",
      "severity": "high"
    }
  ],
  "lesson": "JavaScript Proxy pattern is incredibly powerful for eliminating boilerplate - 16 wrapper methods replaced by single Proxy handler, maintaining full API compatibility while reducing code by 60%. Browser-side code requires different architectural patterns than Node.js extensions.",
