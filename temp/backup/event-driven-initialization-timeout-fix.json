  "root_cause": "SystemCommandHandler awaited full initialization completion (~30s for 63 files with API calls) before returning response, exceeding VSCodeBridge 30s timeout. MessageReceiver couldn't postMessage until async handler completed, blocking entire UI thread.",

      "DependencyContainer.ts: Added setWebviewPanel() method and storage, passes panel in getDependencies()",
