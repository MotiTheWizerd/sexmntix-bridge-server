  "summary": "Untested semantic search implementation → Comprehensive end-to-end validation proving system works perfectly with real queries",
  "root_cause": "System was implemented but never validated with real semantic queries to verify embedding quality, relevance ranking, and incremental indexing behavior",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Systematic testing with diverse semantic queries covering technical concepts, UI design terms, and architectural patterns - verified result relevance and tested incremental indexing by re-initializing after adding new session log",
    "key_changes": [
      "No code changes - pure validation testing",
      "Tested query: 'refactoring bridge architecture' - verified found all 3 bridge refactoring files ranked by relevance",
      "Tested query: 'glassmorphism UI design' - verified found all UI design files with glassmorphism work",
      "Tested query: 'proxy pattern dynamic methods' - verified found exact file using JavaScript Proxy pattern",
      "Tested query: 'event driven timeout fix' - initially missing new file, then found after re-initialization proving incremental indexing works",
      "Tested query: 'over engineering warning' - verified semantic understanding of architectural concerns"

  "validation": "All semantic queries returned highly relevant results ranked by similarity score, incremental indexing successfully picked up newly added session log after re-initialization, cosine similarity ranking proved accurate",
  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "Query 'event driven timeout fix' didn't find today's session initially because session log was created AFTER initialization",
