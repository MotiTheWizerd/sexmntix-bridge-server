  "summary": "Flat basic UI design → Premium metallic design system with chrome gradients, blue steel accents, and hardware-inspired aesthetics",
  "root_cause": "Initial search page design was functional but lacked visual polish and premium feel - buttons and components used basic flat colors without depth or personality",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Comprehensive metallic design system with brushed metal gradients, inset shadows, reflective overlays, blue steel glow effects, and tactile interaction feedback",
    "key_changes": [
      "search-page.css: Transformed all buttons with chrome/blue-steel gradients, inset shadows, and reflective shine overlays creating 3D pressed metal effect",
      "search-page.css: Result cards redesigned as brushed metal panels with subtle shine overlay and diagonal light sweep on hover",
      "search-page.css: All badges (component, complexity, date) given metallic finish with appropriate color coding (blue steel for complexity)",
      "search-page.css: Input fields converted to recessed metal panels with inset shadows and blue glow on focus",
      "search-page.css: Added metallic-pulse animation for active filter buttons creating breathing LED effect",
      "search-page.css: Tags given brushed titanium finish with interactive hover lift",
      "search-page.css: Results header and filter panel wrapped in metallic chrome containers",
      "search-page.css: Reduced search button padding (10px 18px → 8px 14px) for more compact appearance"
