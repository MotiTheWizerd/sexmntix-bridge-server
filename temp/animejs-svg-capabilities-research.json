  "summary": "Need for advanced SVG animation capabilities → Complete understanding of Anime.js SVG features including morphTo, createDrawable, and createMotionPath with practical implementation patterns",

  "root_cause": "Required deep understanding of Anime.js SVG-specific features to create complex, production-quality logo animations beyond basic CSS keyframes",

  "solution": {
    "approach": "Systematic research of official Anime.js SVG documentation across four key areas: general SVG capabilities, shape morphing, path drawing, and motion path animations",
    "key_changes": [
      "Research: Documented morphTo() function for SVG shape morphing with precision parameter (0-1 range)",
      "Research: Documented createDrawable() for line drawing animations using draw property ('0 0' to '1 1' values)",
      "Research: Documented createMotionPath() for animating elements along SVG paths with automatic rotation",
      "Research: Identified standard animatable SVG properties (opacity, transform, fill, stroke)",
      "Research: Discovered anime.stagger() integration for grid-aware sequential animations"
    ]
  },

  "validation": "Documentation verified against official Anime.js documentation at animejs.com/documentation/svg/*",

  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "morphTo() requires compatible SVG element types between source and target shapes",
      "solution": "Ensure both shapes use same SVG element type (SVGPathElement, SVGPolylineElement, or SVGPolygonElement) for successful morphing",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "medium"
    },
    {
      "issue": "morphTo() precision parameter behavior: 0 means no interpolation, higher values add points",
      "solution": "Use precision between 0.3-0.5 for smooth transitions, 0 for exact point matching only",
      "category": "configuration",
      "severity": "low"
    },
    {
      "issue": "createDrawable() draw property uses string format with two space-separated values",
      "solution": "Format as 'start end' where both are 0-1 range (e.g., '0 1' for full line, '0.5 1' for second half)",
      "category": "configuration",
      "severity": "low"
    },
    {
      "issue": "createMotionPath() returns object that must be spread into animation config",
      "solution": "Use spread operator: ...svg.createMotionPath('path') to apply translateX, translateY, and rotate properties",
      "category": "integration",
      "severity": "medium"
    }
  ],

  "lesson": "Anime.js provides three powerful SVG-specific utilities (morphTo, createDrawable, createMotionPath) that return pre-configured animation parameters meant to be spread/applied to standard anime() calls. These work in harmony with anime.stagger() for grid-based sequential animations, making them perfect for our cube grid logo system.",
