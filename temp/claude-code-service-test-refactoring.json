  "summary": "Refactored 429-line test file into 5 focused files under 150 LOC each → fixed Jest mocking issues and CLI flag order",
  "root_cause": "Large test file (429 LOC) exceeded Claude's context management capabilities, causing errors during modifications",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Split into focused test files with shared utilities, fixed mocking structure and CLI command format",
    "key_changes": [
      "Split ClaudeCodeService.test.ts into 5 files by functionality",
      "Created __shared__/ folder for test utilities and mock factories",
      "Moved jest.mock() calls to individual test files (Jest requirement)",
      "Fixed CLI flag order: claude --print 'prompt' (not claude 'prompt' --print)",
      "Added ESLint support for test files"
    ]
  },
  "validation": "All 32 tests pass, terminal authentication works correctly",
  "gotchas": [
    {
      "issue": "jest.mock() calls must be in the same file as tests, not imported from shared modules",
      "solution": "Moved jest.mock() declarations to top of each test file, kept shared mock setup logic",

      "severity": "high"

    {
      "issue": "CLI flags must come before arguments: claude --print 'text' not claude 'text' --print",

  "lesson": "Claude works significantly better with files under 150 LOC - large files (200+ LOC) cause context management issues and increase error rates",
