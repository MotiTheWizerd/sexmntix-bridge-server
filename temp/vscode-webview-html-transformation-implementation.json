  "summary": "Hardcoded incomplete HTML template → Dynamic actual index.html transformation for VS Code WebView",
  "root_cause": "WebView panel was creating incomplete HTML manually instead of leveraging existing dashboard HTML, causing missing scripts and broken component loading",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Option A - Transform actual index.html file dynamically with regex-based path replacement and VS Code API injection",
    "key_changes": [
      "MemorySearchPanel.ts: Replaced manual HTML generation with fs.readFileSync() of actual index.html file",
      "MemorySearchPanel.ts: Added transformResourcePaths() method with regex replacement for href/src attributes",
      "MemorySearchPanel.ts: Implemented injectVSCodeAPI() with Content Security Policy and nonce-based script security",
      "MemorySearchPanel.ts: Fixed memorySearchProvider parameter usage - now stored as instance variable and used for message handling",
