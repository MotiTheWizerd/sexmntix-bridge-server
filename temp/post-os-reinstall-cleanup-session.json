  "summary": "Two unused React applications causing build errors and confusion about which UI is active → Clean removal of chat-react and ide-dashboard, clarified that vanilla JS UI in src/ui/modules is the actual running interface",

  "root_cause": "Previous attempts to build React-based UIs were abandoned in favor of vanilla JS, but the React code remained causing dependency issues and build confusion",

    "approach": "Identify unused React apps, verify no extension dependencies, remove folders and npm scripts, document actual UI architecture",
