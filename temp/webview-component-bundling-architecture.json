  "summary": "WebView fetch() security violations → Professional SPA bundling architecture with embedded templates",
  "root_cause": "VS Code WebView cannot dynamically fetch HTML files due to security constraints, causing 403 Forbidden errors for component loading",
  "solution": {
    "approach": "Built complete SPA bundling pipeline: Node.js script reads 15 component files, wraps in <template> tags, injects into index.html, ComponentLoader detects templates first then falls back to fetch for development",
    "key_changes": [
      "scripts/build/bundle-components.js: Created professional bundler reading all component HTML files and generating template tags with proper IDs",
      "ComponentLoader.js: Added loadFromEmbeddedTemplate() method with template detection, path resolution, and fallback to fetch for dev mode",
      "MemorySearchPanel.ts: Implemented auto-detection between bundled HTML (production) and dev HTML with proper file existence checking",
      "package.json: Added build:webview script and integrated into prepackage workflow for automated production builds"
    ]
  },
  "validation": "Bundler successfully processes 15 components into 34KB bundle, template detection works for most components, identified remaining path inconsistency issues",

      "issue": "ComponentLoader.loadFeatureCards() bypassed getTemplatePath() system causing template ID mismatch - searched for 'components-cards-featurecard-template' but template was 'cards-featurecard-template'",

      "issue": "Build pipeline clears dist/ during compile, requiring webview bundle rebuild after TypeScript compilation",
