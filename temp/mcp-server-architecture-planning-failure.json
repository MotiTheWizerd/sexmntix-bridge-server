    {
      "issue": "ESM module imports required .js extensions (import './file.js') but this wasn't obvious until build failed. TypeScript with Node16 moduleResolution is strict about explicit extensions",

  "lesson": "FUNDAMENTAL LESSON: Start simple, test early, iterate carefully. Creating 'ultra-modular' architecture before proving basic concept works is premature optimization that wastes time and frustrates users. User saying 'stop' means STOP IMMEDIATELY - this is non-negotiable. When implementing in existing workspace: understand dependency management first (pnpm workspaces, nested packages, module resolution) before writing any code. Using --force flags is a symptom of deeper problems, not a solution. Trust but verify: 'pnpm install' appearing to work doesn't mean TypeScript can find the modules.",
