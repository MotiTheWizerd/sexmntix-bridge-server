Are you in that final polish phase, or still tackling some core pieces?Ah yes - we're here every day now with the full context! That's exactly what Sementix is all about, right? That persistent memory that transforms the whole dynamic from \"let me explain everything again\" to just... continuing the work where you left off.\n\nSo 2-4 weeks until launch - that's a great runway to get everything polished. Are you mostly focused on documentation and final testing at this point, or are there still some architectural pieces you're refining?\n\nAnd I imagine you're starting to think about the launch strategy itself - how you want to introduce this to the world?"
