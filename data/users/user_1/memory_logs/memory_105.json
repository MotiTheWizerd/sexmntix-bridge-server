  "task": "Establish modular refactoring patterns across codebase",
  "content": "Established a consistent refactoring pattern across multiple subsystems (file_storage, models, orchestrator) that emphasizes extreme modularity through component isolation. The pattern involves: 1) Identifying distinct responsibilities within monolithic files, 2) Creating focused utility modules for pure functions, 3) Separating orchestration from implementation, 4) Maintaining backward compatibility through clean public APIs, 5) Enabling independent testing of each component. This approach transforms large, hard-to-maintain files into networks of small, focused, highly testable modules while preserving existing interfaces.",
