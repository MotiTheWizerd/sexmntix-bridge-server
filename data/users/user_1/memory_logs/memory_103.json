  "task": "Refactor file_storage modules into smaller components",
  "content": "Refactored both memory_log and conversation file storage modules from monolithic single files into well-organized component structures. Created separate modules for path_manager, file_operations, and storage orchestrator. Further refactored path_manager into reusable utilities (path_builder, directory_manager, file_finder, id_parser). This pattern provides maximum reusability and testability while maintaining clean separation of concerns.",
