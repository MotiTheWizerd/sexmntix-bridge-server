  "task": "Refactor MemorySearchResult model into modular components",
  "content": "Transformed the MemorySearchResult dataclass from a 133-line monolithic file into a clean modular structure with separated concerns: validators module for field validation, serializers module for format conversion, factory module for instance creation, and a lightweight model module that coordinates these utilities. Each component is independently testable and reusable across other models. The pattern provides excellent separation of validation logic, serialization logic, and data structure definition.",
